<p>In this stage, we will add an animated selection of buttons and actor cards. We will also count and fix the number of reviews.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Let's start with the animation for the trailer and review buttons. We have already changed the background and text colors earlier; now, let's add a smooth transition: let the shadow appear on the bottom left of the button smoothly for 300 milliseconds. Here is the final <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/796777/HyperCinema_Stage_5.fig" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Figma file</a>.</li>
<li>Add the same smooth shadow when users go over the actor's cards;</li>
<li>Let's add a review summary to their right: sum up and display how many reviews there are and how many were negative and positive. But the most exciting thing is that the block with the summary should always be visible while users scroll through the reviews, as it was stuck to the top of the page.</li>
